Questions:
  - How to represent alarms ?
  - Should we use representation model 1,2,3 or combination of them
  - Can we use poll the XMS to know about topology ?
  - Can

  Alarms hierarchy
 |
 +--Health alarms
 +--Signal Alarms
 +----- Disk Failure
 +----- Loss Of Synchronization
 
 Each device has alarms, and has 'resources' attached to it.
 Resources have their own alarms.
 The alarm representation per device could be:
 
          
   NFP248
     +--NFP248-Instance1
         +-- configuration
         +-- health
         +-- ASI in 1
              +-- loss of signal
              +-- no stream received
         +-- LAN/WAN 1
              +--Link down
              ...
              
     +--NFP248-Instance2
         +-- configuration
         +-- health
         +-- ASI in 1
              +-- loss of signal
              +-- no stream received
         +-- LAN/WAN 1
              +--Link down
              ...
  
If there are several instance of a device, it will be like this:
